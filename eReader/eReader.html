<br>
Behold her, single in the field,<br>
Yon solitary Highland Lass!<br>
Reaping and singing by herself;<br>
Stop here, or gently pass!<br>
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,<br>
And sings a melancholy strain;<br>
O listen! for the Vale profound<br>
Is overflowing with the sound.<br>
<br>
No Nightingale did ever chaunt<br>
More welcome notes to weary bands<br>
Of travellers in some shady haunt,<br>
Among Arabian sands:<br>
A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard<br>
In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,<br>
Breaking the silence of the seas<br>
Among the farthest Hebrides.<br>
<br>
Will no one tell me what she sings?—<br>
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br>
For old, unhappy, far-off things,<br>
And battles long ago:<br>
Or is it some more humble lay,<br>
Familiar matter of to-day?<br>
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,<br>
That has been, and may be again?<br>
<br>
Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang<br>
As if her song could have no ending;<br>
I saw her singing at her work,<br>
And o'er the sickle bending;—<br>
I listen'd, motionless and still;<br>
And, as I mounted up the hill,<br>
The music in my heart I bore,<br>
Long after it was heard no more.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div id="chapter1" class="chapter-thumbnail"><div class="pod">Lines Written in Early Spring</div>
<br>
I heard a thousand blended notes,<br>
While in a grove I sate reclined,<br>
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts<br>
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.<br>
<br>
To her fair works did nature link<br>
The human soul that through me ran;<br>
And much it grieved my heart to think<br>
What man has made of man.<br>
<br>
Through primrose tufts, in that sweet bower,<br>
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;<br>
And 'tis my faith that every flower<br>
Enjoys the air it breathes.<br>
<br>
The birds around me hopped and played:<br>
Their thoughts I cannot measure,<br>
But the least motion which they made,<br>
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.<br>
<br>
The budding twigs spread out their fan,<br>
To catch the breezy air;<br>
And I must think, do all I can,<br>
That there was pleasure there.<br>
<br>
If this belief from heaven be sent,<br>
If such be Nature's holy plan,<br>
Have I not reason to lament<br>
What man has made of man?<br>

<div id="chapter2" class="chapter-thumbnail"><div class="pod">Composed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802</div>
<br>
Earth has not anything to show more fair:<br>
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by<br>
A sight so touching in its majesty:<br>
This City now doth, like a garment, wear<br>
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,<br>
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie<br>
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;<br>
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.<br>
Never did sun more beautifully steep<br>
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;<br>
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!<br>
The river glideth at his own sweet will:<br>
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;<br>
And all that mighty heart is lying still!<br>
