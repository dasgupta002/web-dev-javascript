Introduction
<br>
<br>
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
environment(for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
connected to the objects of its environment to provide
programmatic control over them.
JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
Array, Date, Math and a core set of language elements such as
operators, control structures and statements. Core JavaScript
can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it
with additional objects.<br>
Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages,
can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in
JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.
In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties
and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object,
with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material
it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have
properties, which define their characteristics.

What you should already know<br><br>
No doubt about it–JavaScript is absolutely essential for any
web developer. Gone are the days when you could get by with a
little CSS and HTML.
JavaScript has only three primitive data types: String, Number,
and Boolean. Everything else (if it’s not null or undefined)
can have properties added to it.
More and more languages are getting support for treating
functions as values, but depending on your background this
may not be at all familiar to you.
Developers coming from a Java or C# background are used to
so-called “foreach” loops, which iterate over all the values
in a collection. JavaScript doesn’t (currently) have an
equivalent loop.
All developers, in every language, should avoid using global
variables. But it’s easy to do by accident in Javascript
because nobody’s forcing you to organize your code into modules.

JavaScript and Java<br><br>
Both Java and JavaScript are written, assembled and executed
differently, and each has dramatic differences when it comes
to what it is capable of doing. Java is used in a wide range
of places, including Android apps, credit card programming
and in the creation of desktop applications and web enterprise
applications. By comparison, JavaScript is mainly used to make
web pages more interactive. It can be used as an alternative
to Flash, though most programmers will tell you that JavaScript
is more popular and has more functionality than Flash.
JavaScript can be used to do neat things like creating
animation in HTML.In a nutshell, when it comes to how each
language is used, Java is typically used for all server side
development, while JavaScript is reserved for developing
client side scripts for functions like validation and
interactivity. There are some other key differences:<br>
<ul>
<li>Java code must be compiled, and JavaScript code is
all-text.
<li>JavaScript code is run on a browser only, while Java
creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser.
<li>Java is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language, and
JavaScript is specifically an OOP scripting language.
</ul>

<div class="world">
Hello World<br><br>
This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the
language itself. But we need a working environment to run
our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is
a good choice. We’ll keep the amount of browser-specific
commands (like alert) to a minimum so that you don’t spend
time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment
(like Node.js).<br>
<script><br>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );<br>
 </script><br>
So first, let’s see how we attach a script to a webpage.
For server-side environments (like Node.js), you can execute
the script with a command like "node my.js".
</div>
<div class="iable">
Variable<br><br>
A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables
 to store goodies, visitors, and other data. To create a
variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword. The statement
below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the
name “message”.<br>
let message;
</div>
<div class="vari">
Variable Declaration<br><br>
Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes
variables which hold the data value and it can be changed
anytime. JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a
variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign
a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you
declare it or before using it.<br>
Syntax:<br>
var <variable-name>;<br>
var <variable-name> = <value>;<br>
var total=0;<br>
</div>
<div class="able">
Variable Scope<br><br>
To work with JavaScript efficiently, one of the first things
you need to understand is the concept of variable scope. The
scope of a variable is controlled by the location of the
variable declaration, and defines the part of the program
where a particular variable is accessible. Scoping rules vary
from language to language. JavaScript has two scopes – global
and local. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs
to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere
in your code. Each function has its own scope, and any variable
declared within that function is only accessible from that
function and any nested functions. Because local scope in
JavaScript is created by functions, it’s also called function
scope. When we put a function inside another function, then we
create nested scope. Currently, JavaScript, unlike many other
languages, does not support block level scoping. This means
that declaring a variable inside of a block structure like a
for loop, does not restrict that variable to the loop.
Instead, the variable will be accessible from the entire
function. It’s worth noting that the upcoming ECMAScript 6
will support block level scopes via the let keyword.
